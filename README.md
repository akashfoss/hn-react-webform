# React-Drupal-Webform
With this awesome React component, you can render complete Drupal Webforms in React. With validation, easy custom styling and a modern, clean interface.

## Installation

First, install *react-drupal-webform* in your project:
```bash
$ npm install react-drupal-webform
# or
$ yarn add react-drupal-webform
```
Then, import the component:
```javascript
// ES6
import Webform from 'react-drupal-webform';
// ES5
var Webform = require('react-drupal-webform').default;
```
This project uses *CSS Modules*, *CSS.next* and *ES7* to ease styling. Your web-bundler (like Webpack) needs to support *CSS Modules* to correctly parse all styling.
